# TOR Hidden Service
Start a simple TOR Hidden Service.

## Service
In this Case, the hidden Service is a NGinx Container which supports php. If you want to switch the App for your project, you need to replace the nginx with your own App. Important is, that the containers name is still hidden-service and it exposes your project on Port 80.
